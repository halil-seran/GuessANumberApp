Guess A Number App With React Native (Your phone is trying to guessing number that you choose)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
I developed this app on windows machine and unfortunately because of this you can not run my app on ios                                                                             
this is because of a restriction from Apple
