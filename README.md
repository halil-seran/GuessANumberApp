Guess A Number App With React Native (Your phone is trying to guessing number that you choose)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
I developed this app on windows machine and unfortunately because of this i can not test my app on ios                                                                        
this is because of a restriction from Apple
So there may be bugs on IOS 
                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
How can you run my app easily?
